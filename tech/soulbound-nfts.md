## The benefits

The Soulbound non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital asset that is used by Open Info for verification, certification, and flagging. It is a specialized type of NFT that is designed to be tamper-proof and resistant to forgery, making it ideal for use in situations where openly verifiable trust is critical.

{% hint style="info" %}
Soulbound-NFTs are irrefutable,

* they can always be openly verified on the blockchain through EtherScan,
* they are solely unique,
* cannot be transferred, and
* they cannot be burned unless approved by Open Info.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
