## Valid Criteria:

Open Info tracks and monitors individuals or organizations through their perceived reputation. Those that have been (inter)acting maliciously, are flagged. To flag a given address, evidence must be shared that can prove the address has acted in a harmful manner.\
\
Accepted evidence includes, but is not limited to the following

* scams
* phishing
* identity theft
* hacks,
* rug pulls, and
* cringe behaviour.

## Rewards:

Until VRFD.info comes out of Beta, rewards will not be integrated into the app itself but received as one of two things:

* Random Airdrop
* Giveaway contest
